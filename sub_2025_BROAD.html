		<p style="margin:0;" }><p> <u> Introduction </u>
			<ul style="list-style: none;" >
				<li> The first goal of this course is to introduce students to the idea that data figures can tell a story. The second goal is to show students how large language models can be used as your own personal data staff in constructing such figures, eliminating the need to learn statistical software. We will start by discussing the figures students bring in as part of the pre-assignment (see below). We will then show how ChatGPT can be used to turn plain-engligh prompts into figures. We will spend the reminder of our time in class working through several exercises designed to increase your proficiency at making figures that tell a story.   
			</ul>	
		<br>
		<p style="margin:0;" }><p> <u> Pre-course assignment </u>
			<ul style="list-style: none;" >
				<li> 1. Please choose two figures that you come across in your everyday work life to share with the class. The first figure should be one that you think does a GOOD job telling a story. The second should be one you think does a POOR job telling a story. Please submit these figures under Assignment 1 in Canvas by Sunday August 3 at 11:59pm. When saving your figures, use the convention "LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME_#", where # is 1 or two. Please DO NOT label them GOOD or POOR. That is what we will discuss!
				<li> <font color="white"> NOTE </font>  
				<li> 2. Please find some dataset from your everyday work life, or some other dataset that interests you, with which you would like to make a figure that tells a story. Please make sure these data are NOT PROPRIETARY. Please make a figure summarizing some aspect of these data. Please upload both the dataset and the figure to Canvas by Sunday August 3 at 11:59pm. The naming convention for the figure is "LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME_3". The naming convention for the dataset is "LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME_DATA".  
				<li> <font color="white"> NOTE </font>  
				<li> 3. Skim through the notes I am working on entitled "Data Analysis for Consumers" and read the parts you find most interesting. Once it is done, these notes should have content related to all of the topics David and Hanseul have told me you would like to discuss. 				
			</ul>
		<br>	  
		<p style="margin:0;" }><p> <u> Post-course assignment </u>
			<ul style="list-style: none;" >
				<li> I will give you a dataset. Each A-team will produce a short slide-deck telling an intersting story using those data, and present those slide decks to the whole class when we meet for our virtual class day on Friday August 22, 2025. Further details will be provided when we meet in August.

		<p style="margin:0;" }><p> <u> Required Readings and Software </u>
			<ul style="list-style: none;" >
				<li> Links to any required readings will appear in the table at the top of this webpage. We will make extensive use of ChatGPT via <a href="https://ai.yale.edu/yales-ai-tools-and-resources/clarity-platform"> Yale's Clarity Platform</a>. Please make sure you know how to connect to that platform before we meet in person.

		<br>
		<p style="margin:0;" }><p> <u> Grading </u>
			<ul style="list-style: none;" >
				<li> Your grade will be determined by your completion of the pre-course assignment, and your performance on the post-course assignment.  
			</ul>
		<br>	  
		<p style="margin:0;" }><p> <u> Academic Integrity </u>
			<ul style="list-style: none;" >
				<li>No student's name should appear on a group project if the student has not contributed to the production of the project. The following is an example of unacceptable conduct: Neo agrees to produce a case write-up, putting Trinity's name on the case write-up. Trinity agrees to repay Neo by producing a subsequent assignment on his own.
				<li> <font color="white"> NOTE </font>  
				<li> In group work, all group members are responsible for the integrity of work that is submitted. Group members should always question other members about the source of material and analysis that is being included in group projects. If a group member has any concerns about the integrity of material being submitted by the group, that group member should discuss those concerns with the instructor.
				<li> <font color="white"> NOTE </font>  
				<li>Note that I re-use assignments over time. It is a violation of academic integrity to rely on any work from prior iterations of this or any related course in working on your assignments for this iteration of the course. 
		</ul>
		<br>	  
		<p style="margin:0;" }><p> <u> Plagiarism </u>
			<ul style="list-style: none;" >
				<li>The members of any academic community are expected not to present ideas or material from other sources as their own. In the context of this course, it is acceptable to, for example:
				<li> <font color="white"> NOTE </font>  
				<ul style="list-style: circle;" >
					<li>Refer to concepts, frameworks, and analytical tools from the readings or class lectures without citation. For example, you may refer to productivity, the laffer curve, keynesian assumptions, and so on without citing the source.
					<li>However, it is not acceptable to quote or paraphrase analysis from another source and present it as your own, where "another source" includes current classmates, past students of the course, or AI/LLMs like ChatGPT. There is a difference between consulting a source and then forming your own opinion based on what you have read, and "lifting" material directly.
