			 data-tooltip="We examine US workers' employment and earnings before and after trade liberalization with China. Among workers initially employed in manufacturing, we find substantial and persistent declines in both outcomes, with indirect exposure via input-output linkages exacerbating the negative effects of direct exposure. For workers initially employed outside manufacturing, however, we find that the positive impact of greater upstream exposure via inputs more than offsets the adverse impacts of own- and downstream exposure, inducing relative earnings $gains$. We also find that spatial exposure is more influential than industry exposure."

Empirically, we introduce a method for distinguishing between these Japanese versus spot-market (i.e., American) relationships in customs data, show that their use varies intuitively across trading partners and products, and find that Japanese importing from China increases after a reduction in the possibility of a trade war. Extending the standard general equilibrium trade model to encompass potential trade wars and relational contracts, we estimate that eliminating Japanese procurement reduces welfare about a third as much as moving to autarky.

			data-tooltip="We propose a method for identifying exposure to changes in trade policy based on asset prices that has several advantages over standard measures: it encompasses all avenues of exposure, it is natively firm-level, it yields estimates for both goods and service producers, and it can be used to study reductions in difficult-to-quantify non-tariff-barriers in a way that controls naturally for broader macroeconomic shocks. Applying our method to two well-studied US trade liberalizations provides new insight into service sector responses to trade liberalizations as well as dramatically different responses among small versus large firms, even within narrow industries."

			data-tooltip="We document the role of intangible capital in manufacturing firms' substantial contribution to non-manufacturing employment growth from 1977-2019. Exploiting data on firms' ``auxiliary'' establishments, we develop a novel measure of proprietary in-house knowledge and show that it is associated with increased growth and industry switching. We rationalize this reallocation in a model where firms combine physical and knowledge inputs as complements, and where producing the latter in-house confers a sector-neutral productivity advantage facilitating within-firm structural transformation. Consistent with the model, manufacturing firms with auxiliary employment pivot towards services in response to a plausibly exogenous decline in their physical input prices."

			data-tooltip="The County Business Patterns data published by the US Census Bureau track employment by county and industry from 1946 to the present. Two features of the data limit their usefulness to researchers: (1) employment for the majority of county-industry cells is suppressed to protect confidentiality, and (2) industry classifications change over time. We address both issues. First, we develop a linear programming method that exploits the large set of adding-up constraints implicit in the hierarchical arrangement of the data to impute missing employment. Second, we provide concordances to map all data to a consistent set of industry codes. Finally, we construct a user-friendly, 1975 to 2016 county-level panel that classifies industries according to a consistent set of 2012 NAICS codes in all years."

			data-tooltip="Manufacturers perform the majority of US patenting and R\&D. The decades-long decline of US manufacturing employment raises concerns that US innovation will falter. We investigate the relationship between between physical production and innovation by constructing a new dataset linking all US firms and their establishments to location geocodes and innovative activities. Preliminary results indicate that while firms with both manufacturing and innovation establishments exhibit higher patenting when these facilities are more spatially proximate, manufacturing firms' overall contribution to US innovation declines steadily and substantially over time. Moreover, cohorts of firms permanently exiting manufacturing in the 1990s and 2000s continue to patent at their prior pace."

			data-tooltip="We show that unexpected changes in the trajectory of COVID-19 infections predict US stock returns, in real time. Parameter estimates indicate that an unanticipated doubling of projected infections forecasts next-day decreases in aggregate US market value of 4 to 11 percent, indicating that equity markets may begin to rebound even as infections continue to rise, if the trajectory of the disease becomes less severe than initially anticipated. Using the same variation in unanticipated projected cases, we find that COVID-19-related losses in market value at the firm level rise with capital intensity and leverage, and are deeper in industries more conducive to disease transmission. These relationships provide important insight into current record job losses. Measuring US states' drops in market value as the employment weighted average declines of the industries they produce, we find that states with milder drops in market value exhibit larger initial jobless claims per worker. This initially counter-intuitive result suggests that investors value the relative ease with which labor versus capital costs can be shed as revenues decline. "

			data-tooltip="This paper examines how prices set by multinational firms vary across arm’s-length and relatedparty customers. Comparing prices within firms, products, destination countries, modes of transport and month, we find that the prices U.S. exporters set for their arm’s-length customers are substantially larger than the prices recorded for related-parties. This price wedge is smaller for commodities than for differentiated goods, is increasing in firm size and firm export share, and is greater for goods sent to countries with lower corporate tax rates and higher tariffs. We also find that changes in exchange rates have differential effects on arm’s-length and related-party prices; an appreciation of the dollar reduces the difference between the prices."

			 data-tooltip="We examine election voting and legislators' roll-call votes in the United States over a twenty-five year period. Voters in areas more exposed to trade liberalization with China in 2000 subsequently shift their support toward Democrats, relative to the 1990s, though this boost for Democrats wanes after the rise of the Tea Party in 2010. House members' votes in Congress rationalize these trends, with Democratic representatives disproportionately supporting protection during the early 2000s. Together, these results imply that voters in areas subject to higher import competition shifted votes toward the party more likely to restrict trade..

			data-tooltip="We examine the impact of trade liberalization on domestic investment in the U.S. manufacturing sector. Using a difference-in-differences identification strategy, we find that industries more exposed to an increase in import competition exhibit relative declines in investment. We find that establishment exit plays a key role in the investment adjustment, and that, along the intensive margin, the decline in investment is concentrated among establishments with low initial levels of labor productivity, capital intensity and skill intensity. Analysis of investment patterns before and after the liberalization suggests that, for certain establishments, investment activity is less lumpy following the policy change."

			data-tooltip="US manufacturing since World War II exhibits three notable trends, illustrated in the two panels of Figure 1. First, manufacturing employment has diverged from non-manufacturing employment, as shown on different axes in Figure 1A. While both series moved upward until the late 1970s, manufacturing employment then begins to decline, even as other non-farm employment continues a steady rise. As a result, there is a continual decline in manufacturing employment’s share of total US non-farm employment, from 32 percent in 1948 to 8 percent in 2017. Second, while US manufacturing employment fell just 12 percent over the 21 years between the post-war peak in 1979 and 2000, it then dropped by more than twice as much—25 percent—from 2000 to 2012. Third, despite the relative flatness and subsequent sharp decline in US manufacturing employment, the bottom panel of Figure 1 shows a steady rise in manufacturing real value added at more or less the same rate as non-manufacturing GDP over the same period, at least between the late 1970s and the Great Recession. The combination of relatively steady and then declining employment, and rising output, indicates that, over the long term, labor productivity has risen faster in the manufacturing sector than in the broader economy."

			data-tooltip="Research in international trade has changed dramatically over the last twenty years, as attention has shifted from countries and industries towards the firms actually engaged in international trade. The now-standard heterogeneous firm model posits measure zero firms that compete under monopolistic competition and decide whether to export to foreign markets. However, much of international trade is dominated by a few “global firms,” which participate in the international economy along multiple margins and account for substantial shares of aggregate trade. We develop a new theoretical framework that allows firms to have large market shares and to decide simultaneously on the set of production locations, export markets, input sources, products to export, and inputs to import. Using U.S. firm and trade transactions data, we provide strong evidence in support of this framework’s main predictions of interdependencies and complementarities between these margins of firm international participation. Global firms participate more intensively along each margin, magnifying the impact of underlying diferences in firm characteristics, and increasing their shares of aggregate trade. "

			data-tooltip="This paper links the sharp drop in US manufacturing employment after 2000 to a change in US trade policy that eliminated potential tariff increases on Chinese imports. Industries more exposed to the change experience greater employment loss, increased imports from China, and higher entry by US importers and foreign-owned Chinese exporters. At the plant level, shifts toward less labor-intensive production and exposure to the policy via input-output linkages also contribute to the decline in employment. Results are robust to other potential explanations of employment loss, and there is no similar reaction in the European Union, where policy did not change. (JEL D72, E24, F13, F16, L24, L60, P33)"

These other dimensions include multi-product firms, offshoring, intra-firm trade and firm export market dynamics."

We use this algorithm to construct the first comprehensive concordance of HS codes over time, and show how this concordance can be extended to incorporate future revisions. We then characterize the extent of HS-code changes since 1989 and discuss how controlling for these revisions is critical for understanding the growth of U.S. trade.

In the real world, of course, trade can involve long chains of potentially independent actors who move goods through wholesale and retail distribution networks. These networks likely affect the magnitude and nature of trade frictions and hence both the pattern of trade and its welfare gains. To promote further understanding of the means by which goods move across borders, this paper examines the extent to which U.S. exports and imports flow through wholesalers and retailers versus “producing and consuming” firms.

The behavior we observe is consistent with a natural generalization of existing theories of industry dynamics that incorporates endogenous product selection within firms.

			data-tooltip="China’s exports have grown dramatically over the last three decades in large part due to its rapid penetration of new product markets. To help address the implications of this growth for developed economies, this paper gauges the relative sophistication of Chinese exports along two dimensions. First, I measure China’s export overlap with developed countries by comparing the set of products China exports to the United States with the bundle of products exported by the OECD. Second, I compare Chinese and other countries’ exports within product markets in terms of the price they receive in the US market. While China’s export overlap with the OECD is much greater than one would predict given its low wages, the prices that US consumers are willing to pay for China’s exports are substantially lower than the prices they are willing to pay for OECD exports. This fact, as well as the increase in the ‘OECD premium’ over time, suggests that competition between China and the world’s most developed economies may be less direct than their product-mix overlap implies. It may also reflect efforts by developed-country firms to compete with China by dropping their least sophisticated offerings and moving up the quality ladder."

When firms possess heterogeneous productivity, countries differ in relative factor abundance, and industries vary in factor intensity, falling trade costs induce reallocations of resources both within and across industries and countries. These reallocations generate substantial job turnover in all sectors, spur relatively more creative destruction in comparative advantage industries than in comparative disadvantage industries, and magnify ex ante comparative advantage to create additional welfare gains from trade. The improvements in aggregate productivity as countries liberalize dampen and can even reverse the real-wage losses of scarce factors."

We find that industries experiencing relatively large declines in trade costs exhibit relatively strong productivity growth. We also find that low-productivity plants in industries with falling trade costs are more likely to die; that relatively high-productivity non-exporters are more likely to start exporting in response to falling trade costs; and that existing exporters increase their shipments abroad as trade costs fall.

Motivated by the factor proportions framework, we introduce a new measure of industry exposure to international trade that focuses on where imports originate rather than on their overall level. We find that plant survival and growth are negatively associated with industry exposure to low-wage country imports. Within industries, we show that manufacturing activity is disproportionately reallocated towards capital-intensive plants. Finally, we provide the first evidence that firms adjust their product mix in response to trade pressures. Plants are more likely to switch industries when exposure to low-wage countries is high."

If so, can anything be done to reverse the Latin American trends, or should we think of the region’s fate as unalterable? To help answer these questions, this paper draws upon standard trade theory and cross-sectional empirical analysis to demonstrate that natural-resource-intensive sectors, particularly permanent agriculture, absorb capital that might otherwise flow to manufacturing. This depresses workers’ incentive to accumulate skill and delays industrialization."
